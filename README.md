Realistic Animal Products and Drops Mod (Formerly Improved Mob Drops Mod)

This mod aims to add more realistic drops for Minecraft's passive and hostile mobs.  Hide is collected from animals, and is crafted with tannin powder to make leather. Both hide and leather armor can be crafted, from hide and leather respectively, and hide armor is weaker than leather.  Venom sacs are collected from killing spiders/cave spiders or crafting pufferfish, and are used to CRAFT splash potions of poison I.  Horses, bats, cats, wolves, sheep and squid now drop meat that can be eaten raw or cooked.
